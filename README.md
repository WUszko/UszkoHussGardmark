# UszkoHussGardmark
This repository contains the model code from the manuscript "Smaller species but larger stages: warming effects on inter- and intraspecific community size structure" by Wojciech Uszko, Magnus Huss and Anna GÃ¥rdmark.

The code numerically simulates the dynamics of Communities I, II and III across time. For more details on model equations and parameters see Tables S1.1 and S1.2 in Appendix S1.

The MATLAB and Python versions are equivalent.
